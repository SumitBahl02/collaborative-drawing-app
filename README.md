## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Frontend)

While this project currently uses a **command-line client**, it can be extended with a **frontend** for a more user-friendly experience. Here‚Äôs how:

### Frontend Ideas
1. **React Frontend**:
   - Use **React** and **React-Konva** to create a web-based drawing interface.
   - Connect to the WebSocket server for real-time updates.

2. **Features to Add**:
   - A visual canvas for drawing.
   - A chat box for real-time messaging.
   - Buttons for undo/redo, save/load, and other commands.

3. **How to Integrate**:
   - The frontend can connect to the existing WebSocket server (`ws://127.0.0.1:8766`).
   - Use the same commands (`DRAW`, `CHAT`, `UNDO`, etc.) to interact with the server.
